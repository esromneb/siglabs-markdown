{"name":"Siglabs-markdown","tagline":"","body":"### Job Description\r\nThis is not your Dad's DSP company.  We are not an office filled with lame engineers, or people who are afraid to speak their mind.  We are former SpaceX employees building the next generation RF network.  Tired of GPS killing your phone battery? Tired of Bluetooth's limited range? Hate paying $100+ to your phone company every month?  Helps us displace all of these technologies at once with the most bleeding edge DSP you've ever seen.\r\n\r\nWe've figured out all the physics, and now we need you to help us with the networking.  You will be helping implement OSI layer 1/2 for our ultra high performance network.  You will be taking Matlab models and converting them into reliable Python / C code on embedded Linux.  You will be building new concepts with these building blocks including: time/frequency division multiplexing, channel management, link management, link encryption, packet framing, store and forward.\r\n\r\nWe have an awesome office in Menlo Park with drones, a 3D Printer, two CNC machines, a lathe, a clean room and tall ceilings all around.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a candidate who is passionate about technology and improving the world.  Because this is a startup environment we value \"self starters\" and people who are always looking for more efficient and cool technologies to solve problems.\r\n\r\n### Required Skills\r\n\r\nOSI Network Experience, IPv4, Python, Linux, System Administration, Network Operations\r\n\r\nNice to have:\r\n\r\nDrone Pilot, Matlab, DSP, Verilog, VHDL, GNU Radio, C++, javascript, IPv6, Soldering skills, any hardware skills, PCB Design\r\n\r\n### About Signal Laboratories\r\n\r\nSigLabs is an engineering organization focused on research and development.
